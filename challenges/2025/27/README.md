# How Many Digits Between 1 and N

Imagine you took all the numbers between 0 and `n` and concatenated them together into a long string.

**How many digits are there between 0 and n?** Write a function that can calculate this.

-   There are 0 digits between 0 and 1.
-   There are 9 digits between 0 and 10.
-   There are 189 digits between 0 and 100.

## Examples

```python
digits(1)
# Output: 0

digits(10)
# Output: 9

digits(100)
# Output: 189

digits(2020)
# Output: 6969
```
