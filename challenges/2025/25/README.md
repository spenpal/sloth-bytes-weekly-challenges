# Birthday Cake Candles

You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. It will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles.

**Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.**

## Examples

```javascript
birthdayCakeCandles([4, 4, 1, 3]);
output = 2;
// The tallest candles are 4. There are 2 candles with this height, so the function should return 2.

birthdayCakeCandles([1, 1, 1, 1]);
output = 4;
// All candles are the same height, so all are the tallest.

birthdayCakeCandles([]);
output = 0;
// No candles, so nothing to blow out.
```
